In order for chat links to work, and for users to see keystone information via tooltip, some C++ in the server needs to be adjusted.

Open the file src/server/game/Handlers/ChatHandler.cpp

Search for the following:

        // Validate hyperlinks
        /*if (!ValidateHyperlinksAndMaybeKick(msg))
        {
            return;
        }

And we are going to comment it out for now, which will disable the strictness related to checking links.

In order to comment out this block of code, copy and paste it with the following -

        // CUSTOM: Remove hyperlink validation for MythicLite. - grimreapaa
        // Validate hyperlinks
        /*if (!ValidateHyperlinksAndMaybeKick(msg))
        {
            return;
        }
        */
